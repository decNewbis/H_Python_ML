- Calculate number of weights on each layer
- Calculate shape of tensors before and after each layer
- Make model overfit the data. Show loss curves with overfit
- Reduce model complexity (number parameters) with keeping accuracy
    add batch norm as well

(add loss curve plot, accuracy plot, classification report and confusion matrix as well)
