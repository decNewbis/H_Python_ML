--== Option 1. Numpy NN ==--

- Report on learning rate, number of epochs, and number of neurons on hidden
- layer influence on the final performance

Optional:

- Introduce more layers to the NN
    Make report on influence of number and width of layers on the final performance
    Make forward pass for a simple MLP on a paper
    In step-by-step form
    In matrix form


--== Option 2. Pytorch NN ==--

- Plot loss curve (both train and test)
- Print model weights (before and after training) and compare with original ones
- Plot results (predicted line along with dataset data)

Optional:

- How predicted line will chance if self.bias = nn.Parameter(0, requires_grad=False)?
- What will be the value of self.bias if self.weights = nn.Parameter(0, requires_grad=False)?
