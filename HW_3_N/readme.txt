Take analytical derivative of sigmoid function (on a paper with pencil, take a photo of your calculation and attach it to pdf report)
Experiments with   demo code (gradient descent)
    * Vary learning rate
    * Vary epochs
    * Plot MSE over training (over epochs for specific learning rate)
Make one forward and backward steps for
    L = (2a + b)(c - d), where a, b, c, d are arbitrary numbers
